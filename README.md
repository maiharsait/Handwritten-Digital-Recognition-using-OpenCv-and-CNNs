# Handwritten-Digital-Recognition-using-OpenCv-and-CNNs
A deep-learning project that recognizes handwritten digits using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and OpenCV. The system processes user-drawn or image-based digits, extracts features, and predicts the correct number with high accuracy, enabling fast and automated digit classification.
